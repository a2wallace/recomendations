You can test the code at the following location:
https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/a2wallace/recommendations/HEAD

You should be able to select the "Load to test ipynb file.jupyterlab-workspace" to have everything you need set up; however, if the nltk_data folder is not present, you will need to open a terminal and run the following command:
python -m nltk.downloader stopwords

Additionally, you may download the "Capstone Angelica Wallace.py" file directly and run the program locally on your system.
